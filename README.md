# Tic-Tac-Toe Basics

## Game URL

https://octater.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client/

## Technologies

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
-   Ajax
-   Rails

## Planning

Created a basic wireframe for the TTT game.  Created user stories for all
published requirements and screen actions

## Development Process

Using the wireframe, constructed the html and css that I could start with.
During the construction, both of these files were updated several times.

From the html, I started coding on functions starting on the top left of the
html.  I would work on the top left dropdown functions until they were somewhat
working as expected.  Then I moved onto the dropdown functions on the top
right.  Finally, I started on the TTT board and scoring engine.  In hindsight,
I wish I would have started this sooner, maybe after I had one dropdown working.

Lastly, I commented out the console logs and errors.

## Problem-solving strategy

Whenever I encountered a problem, I would first go back to my notes and the
presentations.  I used Google almost hourly looking up commands and researching
errors.  Lastly, I would ask my team of developers or open up a problem issue
on Github.

## Unsolved problems

None. (hopefully)
